          <strong>YOUR BROWSER CANNOT RUN THIS EXPERIMENT!</strong> It requires the use of the &lt;canvas&gt; tag, which

        Browser Ball attempts, with only moderate success, to allow the configuration of a seemingly endless array of
        continuous spaces using multiple overlapping browser windows. Within this multivariate space, users are invited
        to toss a beach ball both hither and yon. If this sounds like a ridiculous use of everyone's time, that's only
        because it is.
      </p>
      <p>Clicking the link below spawns the main Browser Ball window, which features two buttons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create Window: this will spawn a new child window. You may position and resize each window as you see fit.
          Browser windows that overlap will become a part of the continuous space in which the beach ball may move.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reset Ball: sometimes things get a little out of hand and the ball falls off the face of the universe. This is
          usually my fault. Click the reset button and you'll be okay.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The main window should also have a beach ball. Fling that puppy around. Make neat spaces for the ball to bounce
        around in. Create complicated layouts that may crash your browser. Have fun.

      Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser Ball requires a JavaScript-enabled web browser that supports the &lt;canvas&gt; tag.</strong>
          Viable browsers include the latest versions of
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313010345/http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>,
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313010345/http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313010345/http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. It will not work
          with any current versions of Internet Explorer.
        </li>
        <li>Closing or refreshing the main window will close any child windows you may have created.</li>
        <li>
          I make no claims as to the physical accuracy of Browser Ball. I have very, very little experience writing
          collision detection systems, and so, quite frequently, the ball will freak out for almost no discernable
          reason. All I can do is apologize profusely for my many, many shortcomings.
