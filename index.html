        Browser Ball was a 2009 interactive web experiment created by Mark Mahoney for the Chrome Experiments website.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was part of a series of experiments designed to showcase the capabilities of Google Chrome and modern web
        technologies of the time, including HTML5 and advanced JavaScript. These experiments were intended to
        demonstrate the potential for creating rich, interactive experiences directly within the web browser, without
        the need for external plugins or software.
      </p>
      <p>
        TODO: Describe the original Browser Ball experiment and its features. Explain the changes made in the
        remastered.
      </p>

          If you'd like to see the original Browser Ball preserved in all its glory, you can view it here

      </p>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>Clicking the link below spawns the main Browser Ball window, which features two buttons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create Window: this will spawn a new child window. You may position and resize each window as you see fit.
          Browser windows that overlap will become a part of the continuous space in which the beach ball may move.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reset Ball: sometimes things get a little out of hand and the ball falls off the face of the universe. This is
          usually my fault. Click the reset button and you'll be okay.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The main window should also have a beach ball. Fling that puppy around. Make neat spaces for the ball to bounce
        around in. Create complicated layouts that may crash your browser. Have fun.
